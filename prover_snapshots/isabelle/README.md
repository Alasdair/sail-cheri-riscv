# Snapshot of Isabelle definitions of CHERI-RISC-V

This directory contains snapshots of the Isabelle theories generated by Sail
for CHERI-RISC-V (with RV64 base architecture).  These snapshots are provided
for convenience, and are not guaranteed to be up-to-date.

It requires [Isabelle 2020](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/website-Isabelle2020/index.html)
to build.

A heap image containing the architecture definitions (as well as the Lem and
Sail libraries in the [lib](lib/) subdirectory) can be built using

```
isabelle build -b -D .
```

This takes roughly 10 minutes on an Intel W-2145 CPU at 3.70GHz.

An interactive session based on this heap image can be started using the
following command (replacing `$DIR` with the path of this directory):

```
isabelle jedit -d $DIR -l Sail-CHERI-RISC-V
```

The model was built with
  * [sail-cheri-riscv](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/sail-cheri-riscv) commit `8c0ba01`
  * [sail](https://github.com/rems-project/sail) commit `63343363`
  * [lem](https://github.com/rems-project/lem) commit `a839114`
and checked against Isabelle 2020.

The snapshots of the Lem and Sail libraries in the [lib](lib/) directory
include copies of the licenses under which these libraries are distributed.
